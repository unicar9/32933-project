       As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you are an experienced full-stack developer who will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining various products and parts of our shared technology infrastructure. The role requires a lot of independence, as the Platform team is small and you will be expected to have a greater-than-average level of autonomy. You must be comfortable and capable of challenging ideas and assumptions, as we interact with people in the C-suite more than other teams might.  In this role, you will be working on a variety of architectural and exploratory projects, as well as providing mentorship and guidance to our product teams. Your expertise will be critical in greenfield projects, where you will be responsible for establishing the technological foundations of new products. You will also work on products early in their lifecycle, providing guidance and support to ensure that they are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
       ‍
       Our tech stack includes TypeScript/React and PHP/Laravel, deployed on the Google Cloud ecosystem. Whilst you may be more of a frontend or backend specialist, you’re comfortable in moving through all parts of the stack to deliver a successful outcome.

        You’re passionate about engineering and you love self development.
        You are approachable and make the team feel able to contribute ideas in a safe working environment.
        You think pragmatically and lean towards using reliable, trusted technology that does the job, rather than introducing new shiny things just for the sake of it
        You effectively communicate in clear language suitable for your audience, in both written and verbal communication. You’re not afraid to ask questions! We don’t expect you to know everything.

   Rex is a 80-person product company based in Tenerife, Brisbane. Rex develops products for the real estate and property management industries in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, with thousands of customers using our CRM, digital advertising suite and website builder.
 
 
  
   
     We’re a design-driven company with a passionate, young team. Together we use our abilities to take complex problems and untangle them into simple, usable products. Ownership is one of our core values, and so we like to give people responsibility and discretion. Our Brisbane office is located in Newstead, close to the Gasworks precinct, surrounded by great cafes, eating areas, and microbreweries.
   
  
  
   
    
     
       About the role
     
     
       As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you are an experienced full-stack developer who will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining various products and parts of our shared technology infrastructure. The role requires a lot of independence, as the Platform team is small and you will be expected to have a greater-than-average level of autonomy. You must be comfortable and capable of challenging ideas and assumptions, as we interact with people in the C-suite more than other teams might.  In this role, you will be working on a variety of architectural and exploratory projects, as well as providing mentorship and guidance to our product teams. Your expertise will be critical in greenfield projects, where you will be responsible for establishing the technological foundations of new products. You will also work on products early in their lifecycle, providing guidance and support to ensure that they are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
       ‍
       Our tech stack includes TypeScript/React and PHP/Laravel, deployed on the Google Cloud ecosystem. Whilst you may be more of a frontend or backend specialist, you’re comfortable in moving through all parts of the stack to deliver a successful outcome.
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       Key Responsibilities
     
     
      
        Mentor product teams and collaborate with the CTO and Product teams on scoping solutions & building proof of concepts.
        Provide technical leadership and foster a culture of growth.
        Proactively identify and mitigate risks, valuing incremental delivery.
        Identifying areas of opportunity to reduce tech debt, and supporting the product teams to modernise legacy projects
        Drive focus on architectural and exploratory projects.
        Communicate cross functionally to ensure productive collaboration between teams
      
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       What you'll bring
     
     
      
        At least 5-7 years of experience working in software engineering or related fields
        Experience with TypeScript/React and PHP/Laravel (or closely related stacks).
        Experience working in an agile environment and collaborating with cross functional teams.
        You’re a nice person who genuinely enjoys uplifting the spirits and skills of those around you.
        You’re passionate about engineering and you love self development.
        You are approachable and make the team feel able to contribute ideas in a safe working environment.
        You think pragmatically and lean towards using reliable, trusted technology that does the job, rather than introducing new shiny things just for the sake of it
        You effectively communicate in clear language suitable for your audience, in both written and verbal communication. You’re not afraid to ask questions! We don’t expect you to know everything.
        Willingness to enthusiastically tackle any part of the stack as needed for the successful shipping of an engineering project, even if it means learning a new skill or being out of your comfort zone.
      
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       Nice to haves

 At IMC, technology is not a department; it’s at the heart of everything we do. Developed in-house, our innovative software makes millions of trading decisions daily, and we win by making better and faster decisions than our competition. 
 IMC’s Sydney based C++ Execution development teams work on software that sits directly in the latency-critical loop of our technology stack and touches every part of our organisation. From ensuring our connectivity to the market and handling massive amounts of data, to implementing complex trading algorithms and integrating advanced hardware solutions.

You’ll write reliable, high-performance software whilst balancing time to production with quality and testability.

 Our tech stack includes an ever-evolving range of systems and technologies, and our engineers have the freedom to choose the best solution for the problem at hand. If a new technology has the potential to add value, we’ll actively invest in exploring, adopting and developing it. 
 These are just some of the technologies our C++ software engineers are currently working with: C++20, linux, git, bazel, gerrit code review, jira and teamcity for our core workflow. A lot of our C++ code also interacts with FPGAs and our Java trading platform. 
 WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT 
 At IMC, no two projects or any two days are the same. You can expect a dynamic, fast-paced environment that delivers a steady stream of challenges. One of the most exciting aspects of the job is our quick feedback loop. 
 Our workforce is just as varied. IMCers are drawn from a broad range of nationalities and backgrounds; what they have in common is their deep technical expertise, extraordinary smarts and highly collaborative approach. We give people lots of responsibility and the support they need to make an impact from day one. As a software engineer, you’ll have the chance to learn everything you need to know about financial markets – it’s just one of the things that make this job more interesting than other tech roles. 
 We promise you a flat structure and an open, collaborative culture that stimulates the sharing of ideas, knowledge and technology between our different teams and offices.

       As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you are an experienced full-stack developer who will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining various products and parts of our shared technology infrastructure. The role requires a lot of independence, as the Platform team is small and you will be expected to have a greater-than-average level of autonomy. You must be comfortable and capable of challenging ideas and assumptions, as we interact with people in the C-suite more than other teams might.  In this role, you will be working on a variety of architectural and exploratory projects, as well as providing mentorship and guidance to our product teams. Your expertise will be critical in greenfield projects, where you will be responsible for establishing the technological foundations of new products. You will also work on products early in their lifecycle, providing guidance and support to ensure that they are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

        You’re passionate about engineering and you love self development.
        You are approachable and make the team feel able to contribute ideas in a safe working environment.
        You think pragmatically and lean towards using reliable, trusted technology that does the job, rather than introducing new shiny things just for the sake of it
        You effectively communicate in clear language suitable for your audience, in both written and verbal communication. You’re not afraid to ask questions! We don’t expect you to know everything.

   Rex is a 80-person product company based in Tenerife, Brisbane. Rex develops products for the real estate and property management industries in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, with thousands of customers using our CRM, digital advertising suite and website builder.
 
 
  
   
     We’re a design-driven company with a passionate, young team. Together we use our abilities to take complex problems and untangle them into simple, usable products. Ownership is one of our core values, and so we like to give people responsibility and discretion. Our Brisbane office is located in Newstead, close to the Gasworks precinct, surrounded by great cafes, eating areas, and microbreweries.
   
  
  
   
    
     
       About the role
     
     
       As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you are an experienced full-stack developer who will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining various products and parts of our shared technology infrastructure. The role requires a lot of independence, as the Platform team is small and you will be expected to have a greater-than-average level of autonomy. You must be comfortable and capable of challenging ideas and assumptions, as we interact with people in the C-suite more than other teams might.  In this role, you will be working on a variety of architectural and exploratory projects, as well as providing mentorship and guidance to our product teams. Your expertise will be critical in greenfield projects, where you will be responsible for establishing the technological foundations of new products. You will also work on products early in their lifecycle, providing guidance and support to ensure that they are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
       ‍
       Our tech stack includes TypeScript/React and PHP/Laravel, deployed on the Google Cloud ecosystem. Whilst you may be more of a frontend or backend specialist, you’re comfortable in moving through all parts of the stack to deliver a successful outcome.
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       Key Responsibilities
     
     
      
        Mentor product teams and collaborate with the CTO and Product teams on scoping solutions & building proof of concepts.
        Provide technical leadership and foster a culture of growth.
        Proactively identify and mitigate risks, valuing incremental delivery.
        Identifying areas of opportunity to reduce tech debt, and supporting the product teams to modernise legacy projects
        Drive focus on architectural and exploratory projects.
        Communicate cross functionally to ensure productive collaboration between teams
      
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       What you'll bring
     
     
      
        At least 5-7 years of experience working in software engineering or related fields
        Experience with TypeScript/React and PHP/Laravel (or closely related stacks).
        Experience working in an agile environment and collaborating with cross functional teams.
        You’re a nice person who genuinely enjoys uplifting the spirits and skills of those around you.
        You’re passionate about engineering and you love self development.
        You are approachable and make the team feel able to contribute ideas in a safe working environment.
        You think pragmatically and lean towards using reliable, trusted technology that does the job, rather than introducing new shiny things just for the sake of it
        You effectively communicate in clear language suitable for your audience, in both written and verbal communication. You’re not afraid to ask questions! We don’t expect you to know everything.
        Willingness to enthusiastically tackle any part of the stack as needed for the successful shipping of an engineering project, even if it means learning a new skill or being out of your comfort zone.
      
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       Nice to haves

 At IMC, technology is not a department; it’s at the heart of everything we do. Developed in-house, our innovative software makes millions of trading decisions daily, and we win by making better and faster decisions than our competition. 
 IMC’s Sydney based C++ Execution development teams work on software that sits directly in the latency-critical loop of our technology stack and touches every part of our organisation. From ensuring our connectivity to the market and handling massive amounts of data, to implementing complex trading algorithms and integrating advanced hardware solutions.

You’ll write reliable, high-performance software whilst balancing time to production with quality and testability.

 Our tech stack includes an ever-evolving range of systems and technologies, and our engineers have the freedom to choose the best solution for the problem at hand. If a new technology has the potential to add value, we’ll actively invest in exploring, adopting and developing it. 
 These are just some of the technologies our C++ software engineers are currently working with: C++20, linux, git, bazel, gerrit code review, jira and teamcity for our core workflow. A lot of our C++ code also interacts with FPGAs and our Java trading platform. 
 WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT 
 At IMC, no two projects or any two days are the same. You can expect a dynamic, fast-paced environment that delivers a steady stream of challenges. One of the most exciting aspects of the job is our quick feedback loop. 
 Our workforce is just as varied. IMCers are drawn from a broad range of nationalities and backgrounds; what they have in common is their deep technical expertise, extraordinary smarts and highly collaborative approach. We give people lots of responsibility and the support they need to make an impact from day one. As a software engineer, you’ll have the chance to learn everything you need to know about financial markets – it’s just one of the things that make this job more interesting than other tech roles. 
 We promise you a flat structure and an open, collaborative culture that stimulates the sharing of ideas, knowledge and technology between our different teams and offices.

    Be pragmatic. Seek to deliver on the bigger picture of generating value for our customers over perfection in code.
    Be helpful. We believe the best work-places are ones where we know there is always someone available to help if we need it. Respond promptly when someone asks for help.
    Be bold. Strive to go outside your comfort zone. We are a small team - and we frequently go into uncharted territory. Even if failure is possible, learning is guaranteed.

   Rex is a 80-person product company based in Tenerife, Brisbane. Rex develops products for the real estate and property management industries in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, with thousands of customers using our CRM, digital advertising suite and website builder.
 
 
  
   
     We’re a design-driven company with a passionate, young team. Together we use our abilities to take complex problems and untangle them into simple, usable products. Ownership is one of our core values, and so we like to give people responsibility and discretion. Our Brisbane office is located in Newstead, close to the Gasworks precinct, surrounded by great cafes, eating areas, and microbreweries.
   
  
  
   
    
     
       About the role
     
     
       As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you are an experienced full-stack developer who will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining various products and parts of our shared technology infrastructure. The role requires a lot of independence, as the Platform team is small and you will be expected to have a greater-than-average level of autonomy. You must be comfortable and capable of challenging ideas and assumptions, as we interact with people in the C-suite more than other teams might.  In this role, you will be working on a variety of architectural and exploratory projects, as well as providing mentorship and guidance to our product teams. Your expertise will be critical in greenfield projects, where you will be responsible for establishing the technological foundations of new products. You will also work on products early in their lifecycle, providing guidance and support to ensure that they are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
       ‍
       Our tech stack includes TypeScript/React and PHP/Laravel, deployed on the Google Cloud ecosystem. Whilst you may be more of a frontend or backend specialist, you’re comfortable in moving through all parts of the stack to deliver a successful outcome.
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       Key Responsibilities
     
     
      
        Mentor product teams and collaborate with the CTO and Product teams on scoping solutions & building proof of concepts.
        Provide technical leadership and foster a culture of growth.
        Proactively identify and mitigate risks, valuing incremental delivery.
        Identifying areas of opportunity to reduce tech debt, and supporting the product teams to modernise legacy projects
        Drive focus on architectural and exploratory projects.
        Communicate cross functionally to ensure productive collaboration between teams
      
     
    
   
  
  
   
    
     
       What you'll bring
     
     
      
        At least 5-7 years of experience working in software engineering or related fields
        Experience with TypeScript/React and PHP/Laravel (or closely related stacks).
        Experience working in an agile environment and collaborating with cross functional teams.
        You’re a nice person who genuinely enjoys uplifting the spirits and skills of those around you.
        You’re passionate about engineering and you love self development.
        You are approachable and make the team feel able to contribute ideas in a safe working environment.
        You think pragmatically and lean towards using reliable, trusted technology that does the job, rather than introducing new shiny things just for the sake of it
        You effectively communicate in clear language suitable for your audience, in both written and verbal communication. You’re not afraid to ask questions! We don’t expect you to know everything.
        Willingness to enthusiastically tackle any part of the stack as needed for the successful shipping of an engineering project, even if it means learning a new skill or being out of your comfort zone.

       As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you are an experienced full-stack developer who will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining various products and parts of our shared technology infrastructure. The role requires a lot of independence, as the Platform team is small and you will be expected to have a greater-than-average level of autonomy. You must be comfortable and capable of challenging ideas and assumptions, as we interact with people in the C-suite more than other teams might.  In this role, you will be working on a variety of architectural and exploratory projects, as well as providing mentorship and guidance to our product teams. Your expertise will be critical in greenfield projects, where you will be responsible for establishing the technological foundations of new products.

        Proactively identify and mitigate risks, valuing incremental delivery.

        You’re a nice person who genuinely enjoys uplifting the spirits and skills of those around you.
        You’re passionate about engineering and you love self development.
        You are approachable and make the team feel able to contribute ideas in a safe working environment.
        You think pragmatically and lean towards using reliable, trusted technology that does the job, rather than introducing new shiny things just for the sake of it

 At IMC, technology is not a department; it’s at the heart of everything we do. Developed in-house, our innovative software makes millions of trading decisions daily, and we win by making better and faster decisions than our competition. 
 IMC’s Sydney based C++ Execution development teams work on software that sits directly in the latency-critical loop of our technology stack and touches every part of our organisation. From ensuring our connectivity to the market and handling massive amounts of data, to implementing complex trading algorithms and integrating advanced hardware solutions. 
 As a software engineer, you’ll work in multidisciplinary teams alongside other engineers as well as traders to deliver challenging projects, while taking ownership for end-to-end product development – from requirements gathering to production. You’ll write reliable, high-performance software whilst balancing time to production with quality and testability. Advanced automated testing and daily deployments will allow you to achieve agile and incremental benefits. 
 Within a complex landscape of varying systems and technologies, you’ll be constantly challenged to consider trade-offs between latency, throughput, simplicity, scalability and maintainability. 
 OUR TECHNOLOGY STACK 
 Our tech stack includes an ever-evolving range of systems and technologies, and our engineers have the freedom to choose the best solution for the problem at hand. If a new technology has the potential to add value, we’ll actively invest in exploring, adopting and developing it. 
 These are just some of the technologies our C++ software engineers are currently working with: C++20, linux, git, bazel, gerrit code review, jira and teamcity for our core workflow. A lot of our C++ code also interacts with FPGAs and our Java trading platform. 
 WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT 
 At IMC, no two projects or any two days are the same. You can expect a dynamic, fast-paced environment that delivers a steady stream of challenges. One of the most exciting aspects of the job is our quick feedback loop. 
 Our workforce is just as varied. IMCers are drawn from a broad range of nationalities and backgrounds; what they have in common is their deep technical expertise, extraordinary smarts and highly collaborative approach. We give people lots of responsibility and the support they need to make an impact from day one. As a software engineer, you’ll have the chance to learn everything you need to know about financial markets – it’s just one of the things that make this job more interesting than other tech roles. 
 We promise you a flat structure and an open, collaborative culture that stimulates the sharing of ideas, knowledge and technology between our different teams and offices.
