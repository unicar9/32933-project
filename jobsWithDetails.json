    "description": "A bit about us\n  At Powerledger we build and deploy software solutions for the tracking, tracing and trading of renewable energy. We are a leader in the tech industry, focusing on doing one thing and doing it very well. Founded in 2016, we have more than 30 clients in 11 countries.\n  We're a growing, profitable business. Our goal is to build a company that will last forever while enjoying the journey and doing work that we are proud of. Our business model involves a deep understanding of our core customers, to deliver purpose-built software, backed up with great customer support and service. We make software that is easy to learn, use and delivers value to our customers.\n  Most of our team is based in Perth, Australia, where the company started, though we've spread to other parts of Australia, the US, Europe and the UK. \n We are looking to grow our engineering team with Full Stack Engineers. We are seeking great problem solvers who enjoy collaborating with others (not just engineers) and who value well written and tested code. There are a lot of things we believe are great about working at Powerledger, but we are biased, so here are the key takeaways that most engineers want to know:\n  Tech Stack: We use a modern cloud native tech stack running React, Springboot, Java, and Mongo deployed using GitHub and Customize to Google Cloud. Our legacy code is three years old and we are a couple of months into redelivering that to suit the growing scale of the company.\n  We have an event driven architecture with our microservices and apis using Kafka (Confluent version) for messaging to support up to 100 million customers per deployment. We’re always advancing our DevOps, currently spiking big data solutions, and adding a number of products to our platform.\n  You will work closely with our platform/DevOps team who will ensure you have the best tools to do your role effectively. We’re scoping tooling to uplift monitoring and measurement of our production environment to provide next level data to steer the direction of the company.\n  We deliver features in slices, working in cross-functional teams, to ensure you will have real ownership over a problem from start to finish. Which includes work on requirement analysis and collaboration with Product Managers and Designers on developing user stories.\n  A typical day might include:\n \n   Working where you work best, perhaps in a home office designed by you, using a device of your choosing, with or without music, in an atmosphere you create for yourself.\n   Solidifying Powerledger’s engineering edge by further improving the platform upon which our world-class front ends are built.\n   Changing source code hosted in GitHub, most of it in the open, collaborating on a pull-request, getting feedback from other Powerledger engineers on how the changes affect them and iterating on this to reach the desired outcome.\n   Pairing with another software engineer or a support engineer to help them reproduce a tricky problem, helping them understand the inner workings of Powerledger’s front end so they can be more helpful to even more customers over time.\n   Pairing with another engineer on a Zoom call to solve a complex technical front end problem or decide how to best architect the front end for new features.\n   Fixing a bug in the front end and writing tests to prevent regressions.\n   Improving our internal documentation to help Powerledger engineers better use our front end technologies and component library.\n   Writing a blog post about something interesting for other developers, or explaining a new feature of Powerledger’s platform.\n \n  You will be a great fit for this role if:\n \n   You enjoy automating things like builds, tests, deployments, infrastructure, and operational tasks.\n   You are able to work independently, motivating yourself to do high-quality work on time, communicating with your teammates when you need help, or when you are ready for something new.\n   You enjoy collaborating with other people to solve a problem, motivating others to discover the best solution by using a balance of passion, pragmatism and empathy.\n   You are a results-oriented person. Someone who is focused on the consistent delivery of value to our customers. You willingly change direction based on clear and transparent business information and help others do the same.\n \n  We would love you to have\n \n   Exceptional programming skills in Java\n   Experience with SQL and NoSQL databases\n   Web Services technologies experience i.e. REST\n   Knowledge of microservices architecture\n   Experience developing Spring Boot services\n   Experience with MongoDB \n  Experience with Apache Kafka \n  Experience with Kubernetes or Docker \n  Experience working with Cloud environments and technologies (GCP preferred)\n   Basic knowledge of blockchain systems\n   A strong level of professional Software Engineering experience\n   An actionable level of knowledge with SOLID / Clean Code Principles\n   Experience with Agile methodologies\n   Proven mentorship and coaching skills\n \n  Requirements\n \n   Ideally you have some experience with our tech stack but we are looking for technology-agnostic engineers who want to use the best tool for the job.\n   Enjoy working in an exciting scale-up where you will drive initiatives and have a real impact on our customers.\n   You have worked across the full stack and enjoy diving into challenges across both the front and back end.\n   Strong communication skills and enjoy working in cross-functional teams.\n   Code quality must always be top of mind.\n   Experience in a large scale environment is highly desirable. We're building processes to handle at least double our current customer base.\n \n  Our culture & benefits\n  At Powerledger, you’ll be part of an inclusive culture where individuality leads. We’re committed to ensuring that no matter where or who you are, everyone feels like they truly belong. Through training, workshops, social events, community partnerships, and company commitments like our Transpositive Inclusion Policy, we strive to foster a supportive working environment with a vibrant, global culture.\n  Powerledger’s company culture and values are based around collaboration, diversity, inclusion and flexibility. Those are all nice words, so here are some more specific examples:\n \n   Training programs\n   Flexible start and finish times\n   Ability to have negative leave balance\n \n  We're continually assessing our employee value proposition alongside career paths as the company grows to ensure we provide a real and sustainable work-life balance.\n  Interested? We'd love to hear from you. Please include a cover letter outlining what you can bring to the role and how Powerledger would be a good fit for you.\n  In addition to your role’s specific outcomes identified above, all staff are expected to provide:\n  Leadership\n \n   Contribute to a positive and innovative organisational culture and values: https://www.powerledger.io/company/our-values \n  Demonstrate leadership for the culture within Powerledger.\n   Look for opportunities to lift the performance of your colleagues in constructive ways.\n   Lead by example.\n \n  Stakeholder Relationships\n \n   Work closely and effectively with key internal and external stakeholders including other staff, consultants and contractors. \n  As needed, represent Powerledger at conferences, workshops and networking events focused on energy regulation.\n \n  Human Resource Management\n \n   Maintain an awareness of and work within Powerledger’s Human Resource policies and procedures.\n \n  Information and Knowledge Management\n \n   Effectively capture, store and use information in accordance with Powerledger’s Knowledge Management policy.\n \n  Financial Management\n \n   Maintain an awareness of and work within business budgets.\n \n  Commercial Management\n \n   Develop and maintain industry knowledge by participating in educational opportunities; reading professional publications; maintaining personal networks; and participating in professional organisations.\n \n  ‍\n  Powerledger is an equal opportunity employer.

    "description": "09th March, 2023 \n  We’re Cowry, the digital experiences team within Australian Payments Plus. Given we’re relatively new here, let’s start by introducing ourselves. AP+ is a family of cornerstone businesses you’d know; BPAY, eftpos, NPP, and while you haven't heard of ‘Cowry’ you probably have heard of a little digital wallet with over 1.5M customers called Beem which is just one of the products powered by us.  Our team love to explore new ground and challenge the status quo in the pursuit of fintech excellence. We live at the intersection of next-generation technology and traditional payments infrastructure, launching products from the ground up. Our mission is pretty simple; keep Australian payments open, keep businesses thriving and go beyond money.  Role @ Cowry We’re adding a Devops Engineer to our already thriving team where you will get to make meaningful contributions to the function and the team and work closely with other engineers, QA and solution Architects.  Key Responsibilities \n  \n   Collaborate with developers to implement and maintain automated build, test, and deployment pipelines \n   Monitor and maintain infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking, to ensure high availability, performance, and security. \n   Develop and maintain automation scripts for tasks such as configuration management, monitoring, and backups. \n   Troubleshoot issues with software applications and infrastructure and provide timely resolution. \n   Stay current with emerging technologies, industry trends, and best practices in DevOps and cloud computing. \n   \n   \n  Skills, Qualifications & Experience\n   \n  \n   Knowledge of software development principles, such as agile methodologies and version control. \n   Knowledge of cloud computing platforms, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. \n   Knowledge of software development principles, such as agile methodologies and version control. \n   Familiarity with containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. \n   Strong problem-solving and troubleshooting skills. \n   Strong communication and collaboration skills.\n  \n   \n   \n   \n  Life @ Cowry\n   We strive to create an environment where every member of the team feels empowered to make a decision for the benefit of our customers.\n   \n   At Cowry, a growth mindset is fundamental to success. We are obsessed with data. It’s how we learn, ask better questions and improve. It allows us to take small bets, learn quickly (often by failing) and dust ourselves off. We believe that to fully embrace experimentation and failure as part of learning, it requires a culture where everyone feels safe enough to push beyond their own fears.\n   \n   You’ll thrive in Cowry if:\n   \n  \n   You have an agile, entrepreneurial mindset & thrive in an environment where you can reimagine your contribution each and every day \n   The idea of working in a “start-up-esq” environment excites you (but you also sleep well at night knowing your job is secure) \n   You love to test the boundaries of your abilities and champion your colleagues to do the same \n   Your job title is just a point of reference for your LinkedIn profile, it doesn’t define who you really are \n   You’re curious at heart, always asking questions and looking for ways to improve \n  Cowry may not be the place for you if:\n   \n  \n   You thrive when working in a hierarchical “clunky” environment \n   Your job title means the world to you and defines who you are \n   You love to work in pre-defined silo’s \n   To you, team & company culture is two dimensional\n  \n   \n   \n   \n  What Next?\n   For us, it’s more important that you are a genuinely decent human, as we believe people can pick up any skill with the right support & mindset.\n   \n   We consciously and intentionally hire from diverse professional and personal backgrounds. We work hard to build a wonderfully diverse team of individuals, measured not by numbers but by contribution and diversity of thinking.\n   \n  \n   Submit your application for the role along with any other materials you’d want to share about yourself as a person or work you’re proud of \n   If we like your vibe, you’ll get a call from our Talent rep to make sure we’re on the same page about salary and role expectations \n   Once we get the admin out of the way, you’ll get a time booked in to meet the hiring manager so they can get to know you better \n   If you’ve made it this far (congrats!) you’ll have a final informal chat with the head of department or CEO \n   \n   Either way, expect to get honest feedback from us along the way as we value it highly.\n   \n   \n  The AP+ team values unique talents & we encourage applications from diverse community groups including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, LGBTIQ+, those with special needs and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds."

You’ll work with our collaborative team of developers, designers, and researchers to improve our customers’ experience, keeping it secure and a delight to use. We work together to write code that is optimised for in-browser speed and resilience. Our web app has to stay responsive while interacting with a sometimes-wayward server. The network isn’t reliable, latency is non-zero, and every missed data binding means one more bizarre state that the interface can enter. There’s always an interesting new challenge to solve!We use the tools the browser provides. Our interfaces are built in JavaScript, on our own Overture framework and the JMAP network standard. This gives us full control from top to bottom to build the right solutions.RequirementsMuch of what we do is bespoke so the most important attribute for success in this role is a willingness to learn and ask questions. The Fastmail web client is a complete network application running in the browser. You'll be learning many parts of the web API that often look cool but don't get used: IndexedDB, web workers, push, and the list goes on. As a web client for real standards, you'll also learn the web, calendar, and contact standards as they are, without lossy mediation by a third party web service API.You’re comfortable working with marketing, design and product managers to collaborate on feature development. You enjoy engaging with your colleagues to find the ideal solution. Experience with design systems is a bonus.You strive to find root causes and apply the fix at the right level of the stack; this includes reading other people’s code and determining why it exists before making changes. You delight in an elegant solution, especially if it makes the user’s experience faster. We take pride in the little details, and we hope you do too.You have excellent written language skills for async communication, strong verbal and interpersonal skills for collaborating in person, patience, diligence, and an ability to gracefully adapt to change.If this sounds like you and you’re not sure if you have enough experience, we encourage you to apply and have a chat with us.BenefitsThis is a full time hybrid role.

We aim to be in the office 3 days a week and you are welcome to work your remaining schedule at home or in the office. We also offer further remote flexibility for life events.We’re in close communication with our colleagues in Philadelphia.

Talk to us if you’re unsure.We encourage employees to write and speak about the great work we do, and to stay engaged with their professional peers.

Australian owned & operated, we are set to become a major player, both in Australia and internationally.The Picklebet team is dedicated to building remarkable products for the betting community; designed to entertain and deliver fun, engaging experiences.After significant growth in 2022, we are looking to expand our development capabilities, for our in house technology stack. Joining as part of a growing team, we need smart, and self-motivated people to come along for the ride, to take us to the next level, and deliver on our mission.Purpose of this role: We are looking for a senior back end developer to work on our live, multi-platform, multi-user entertainment platform. You’ll work closely with our CTO, developers and other stakeholders in a highly collaborative and technical environment.Below are some of the traits and experience that will make you successful in this role:API Development Experience - The primary focus of this role is developing the HTTP APIs and business logic to power the Picklebet platform. We need someone with experience in this area. They will have a history of delivering several projects under their belt. Picklebet is built using Kotlin, experience with other JVM languages is valuable but Kotlin will be the language you use day to day. Proven ability to get things done - We are a small team that build and operate a complex and rapidly scaling betting platform. We are proud of the amount and quality of work we get out the door each week and are looking for someone with a similar attitude and ability. If you want to work somewhere where the code you write today is being used by tens of thousands of customers next week then Picklebet might be for you. This means you're willing to get stuck in and get things done even if it is something outside your day to day role.End to end view of software development - You will be working closely with colleagues to deliver features from inception, design, implementation, QA to deployment and operation. Once live you will be monitoring, iterating and improving your solutions based on customer feedback. Self managed - We are not big on micromanagement at Picklebet, instead giving you the freedom to operate however you choose to perform at your best; this will require a level of ability to manage your own day to day tasks and communicate effectively.Scalable and Performant Solutions - Picklebet is in an exciting transition phase, as our user base grows we are encountering those 'Nice to have' scaling problems start ups have. Experience and interest in solving those kinds of problems is a valuable asset in this role.Databases - We lean heavily on our PostgreSQL database so strong SQL, database design and RDBMS knowledge is a must.Remote working - Ability to work remotely. We work remotely by default but there is an opportunity to work in the Newstead office if that suits you. We try to get into the office once a week because some things are just better face to face.Cloud experience - Experience building applications that run in a cloud environment is essential. Experience configuring and maintaining cloud environments is also valuable.Ability to work in a team - You need to be able to communicate and collaborate effectively in a team environment. As a team we are continually trying to improve, so we are looking for people that want to contribute to that process with new ideas, technologies and approaches that drive our team and product forward.Gambling Industry - Must be willing to work in the gambling industry, we understand that isn't for everyone. Knowledge and background in gambling would be a plus.Front End Web Development - Experience in this area is a bonus. There are opportunities to work on the UI side of the platform but primarily this is a back end role.Education - A Bachelor's Degree or equivalent commercial experience.Qualifications3+ years experience in a similar role.  If you don’t have 3+ years experience but can point to relevant work that impresses this will be acceptable. University qualifications would be desirable but not essential.\n      \n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show more\n\n        \n    \n  \n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show less"

Fillr simply wants their team to be happy while producing products that make other people’s lives that little bit easier. Who is Fillr?Fillr is the world’s most accurate autofill technology, an ultra intelligent data exchange platform with a 95% + accuracy that is proven to be more accurate than Google/Apple’s autofill offerings. Pretty impressive for a small local Melbourne team, huh?It’s an exciting time to be joining Fillr as they are embarking on a new journey after merging with Rakuten Americas whose business portfolio includes market leaders in e-commerce, digital marketing, advertising, business intelligence, logistics, communications, and entertainment. The product They’ve rolled their auto-fill-as-a-service into a suite of mobile apps that are used by thousands of users daily in every country of the world.

To date, their 17 million members in the U.S. alone have earned over $3.7 billion in cash back at their favorite stores. How cool is that? It’s a fascinatingly complex system, with millions of users and that is at the very heart of their business.Rakuten Rewards directly puts money back into the pockets of users, which is pretty damn cool to think about.

Our total team size has recently doubled to over 30 and we have an awesome pipeline of growth projects ahead. We want someone who can work alongside the Founders and CTO to build Bluethumb into the best online art platform in the world. We have succeeded so far by focusing on creating better technology for users. This won't change. Our next years are expanding our core market whilst launching expanding overseas. We will also enter the Secondary Art market and continue building out our NFT marketplace.RequirementsWhat You'll DoBe a staunch advocate for our users; our artists and art collectors. Speak up for the user at every point, dive deep on how they use Bluethumb, distill feature requests through a user-focussed lens. Alongside the CTO, help run the product team sprints. We currently have five full stack developers, a QA and a visual designer. We plan 3 week development sprints, with a code freeze week. Part of the role is roadmap planning ahead of each sprint to work out what we build next, and short retros afterwards. Manage and own the development board. This role is an intentional product team bottleneck. All new bugs, feature suggestions and epics are written into cards by the Product Owner. Ruthlessly prioritise what gets built and what doesn't.

People are in different positions and places and you’ll need to be confident and a strong communicator.You’ll need to process a lot of information and be driven to quickly learn this and help us expand. We put ourselves in situations where failing publicly is a possibility. We understand this is life at Bluethumb and work as hard as possible to succeed, and when there’s failure we learn from the experience and pick ourselves back up to charge on.BenefitsYou’ll receive a competitive salary with the potential to qualify for ESOP (employee share option plan).If you are Melbourne or Adelaide based, we have amazing gallery & office spaces which are Dog-friendly.
