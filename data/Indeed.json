Together we use our abilities to take complex problems and untangle them into simple, usable products. Ownership is one of our core values, and so we like to give people responsibility and discretion. Our Brisbane office is located in Newstead, close to the Gasworks precinct, surrounded by great cafes, eating areas, and microbreweries.\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     \n       About the role\n     \n     \n       As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you are an experienced full-stack developer who will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining various products and parts of our shared technology infrastructure.

In this role, you will be working on a variety of architectural and exploratory projects, as well as providing mentorship and guidance to our product teams. Your expertise will be critical in greenfield projects, where you will be responsible for establishing the technological foundations of new products.

Developed in-house, our innovative software makes millions of trading decisions daily, and we win by making better and faster decisions than our competition. \n IMC’s Sydney based C++ Execution development teams work on software that sits directly in the latency-critical loop of our technology stack and touches every part of our organisation. From ensuring our connectivity to the market and handling massive amounts of data, to implementing complex trading algorithms and integrating advanced hardware solutions. \n As a software engineer, you’ll work in multidisciplinary teams alongside other engineers as well as traders to deliver challenging projects, while taking ownership for end-to-end product development – from requirements gathering to production. You’ll write reliable, high-performance software whilst balancing time to production with quality and testability. Advanced automated testing and daily deployments will allow you to achieve agile and incremental benefits. \n Within a complex landscape of varying systems and technologies, you’ll be constantly challenged to consider trade-offs between latency, throughput, simplicity, scalability and maintainability. \n OUR TECHNOLOGY STACK \n Our tech stack includes an ever-evolving range of systems and technologies, and our engineers have the freedom to choose the best solution for the problem at hand. If a new technology has the potential to add value, we’ll actively invest in exploring, adopting and developing it. \n These are just some of the technologies our C++ software engineers are currently working with: C++20, linux, git, bazel, gerrit code review, jira and teamcity for our core workflow. A lot of our C++ code also interacts with FPGAs and our Java trading platform. \n WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT \n At IMC, no two projects or any two days are the same. You can expect a dynamic, fast-paced environment that delivers a steady stream of challenges. One of the most exciting aspects of the job is our quick feedback loop. \n Our workforce is just as varied. IMCers are drawn from a broad range of nationalities and backgrounds; what they have in common is their deep technical expertise, extraordinary smarts and highly collaborative approach. We give people lots of responsibility and the support they need to make an impact from day one. As a software engineer, you’ll have the chance to learn everything you need to know about financial markets – it’s just one of the things that make this job more interesting than other tech roles. \n We promise you a flat structure and an open, collaborative culture that stimulates the sharing of ideas, knowledge and technology between our different teams and offices. \n OUR HIRING PROCESS \n To set you up for success, you can find details of our hiring process – including tips on applying and interviewing with us – on our website.

The team is responsible for management of the company's premier FX trading platforms providing execution, market data and post-trade services to external and internal clients.  You will be expected to balance between fast response (e.g., electronic trading monitoring and incident management) and longer-term activities (e.g., DevOps, release planning, security and audit reviews). A single day or even a single hour is likely to see a mix of both.  Working in Production Support means you'll use both creative and critical thinking skills to maintain application systems that are crucial to the daily operations of the firm. You'll work collaboratively in teams on a wide range of projects based on your primary area of focus. While learning to fix application and data issues as they arise, you'll also gain exposure to software development, testing, deployment, maintenance and improvement, in addition to production lifecycle methodologies and risk guidelines. Finally, you'll have the opportunity to develop professionally -and to grow your career in any direction you choose.  Key Responsibilities:  Act as a Production Support engineer in the Global Foreign Exchange IT front office production service team, providing first and second level support to the Trading, Sales, and business community for the suite of applications and their associated components.
