You’ll work with our collaborative team of developers, designers, and researchers to improve our customers’ experience, keeping it secure and a delight to use. We work together to write code that is optimised for in-browser speed and resilience. Our web app has to stay responsive while interacting with a sometimes-wayward server. The network isn’t reliable, latency is non-zero, and every missed data binding means one more bizarre state that the interface can enter. There’s always an interesting new challenge to solve!We use the tools the browser provides. Our interfaces are built in JavaScript, on our own Overture framework and the JMAP network standard. This gives us full control from top to bottom to build the right solutions.RequirementsMuch of what we do is bespoke so the most important attribute for success in this role is a willingness to learn and ask questions. The Fastmail web client is a complete network application running in the browser. You'll be learning many parts of the web API that often look cool but don't get used: IndexedDB, web workers, push, and the list goes on. As a web client for real standards, you'll also learn the web, calendar, and contact standards as they are, without lossy mediation by a third party web service API.You’re comfortable working with marketing, design and product managers to collaborate on feature development. You enjoy engaging with your colleagues to find the ideal solution. Experience with design systems is a bonus.You strive to find root causes and apply the fix at the right level of the stack; this includes reading other people’s code and determining why it exists before making changes. You delight in an elegant solution, especially if it makes the user’s experience faster. We take pride in the little details, and we hope you do too.You have excellent written language skills for async communication, strong verbal and interpersonal skills for collaborating in person, patience, diligence, and an ability to gracefully adapt to change.If this sounds like you and you’re not sure if you have enough experience, we encourage you to apply and have a chat with us.BenefitsThis is a full time hybrid role.

We also offer further remote flexibility for life events.We’re in close communication with our colleagues in Philadelphia.

Talk to us if you’re unsure.We encourage employees to write and speak about the great work we do, and to stay engaged with their professional peers.

Australian owned & operated, we are set to become a major player, both in Australia and internationally.The Picklebet team is dedicated to building remarkable products for the betting community; designed to entertain and deliver fun, engaging experiences.After significant growth in 2022, we are looking to expand our development capabilities, for our in house technology stack. Joining as part of a growing team, we need smart, and self-motivated people to come along for the ride, to take us to the next level, and deliver on our mission.Purpose of this role: We are looking for a senior back end developer to work on our live, multi-platform, multi-user entertainment platform. You’ll work closely with our CTO, developers and other stakeholders in a highly collaborative and technical environment.Below are some of the traits and experience that will make you successful in this role:API Development Experience - The primary focus of this role is developing the HTTP APIs and business logic to power the Picklebet platform. We need someone with experience in this area. They will have a history of delivering several projects under their belt. Picklebet is built using Kotlin, experience with other JVM languages is valuable but Kotlin will be the language you use day to day. Proven ability to get things done - We are a small team that build and operate a complex and rapidly scaling betting platform. We are proud of the amount and quality of work we get out the door each week and are looking for someone with a similar attitude and ability. If you want to work somewhere where the code you write today is being used by tens of thousands of customers next week then Picklebet might be for you. This means you're willing to get stuck in and get things done even if it is something outside your day to day role.End to end view of software development - You will be working closely with colleagues to deliver features from inception, design, implementation, QA to deployment and operation. Once live you will be monitoring, iterating and improving your solutions based on customer feedback. Self managed - We are not big on micromanagement at Picklebet, instead giving you the freedom to operate however you choose to perform at your best; this will require a level of ability to manage your own day to day tasks and communicate effectively.Scalable and Performant Solutions - Picklebet is in an exciting transition phase, as our user base grows we are encountering those 'Nice to have' scaling problems start ups have. Experience and interest in solving those kinds of problems is a valuable asset in this role.Databases - We lean heavily on our PostgreSQL database so strong SQL, database design and RDBMS knowledge is a must.Remote working - Ability to work remotely. We work remotely by default but there is an opportunity to work in the Newstead office if that suits you. We try to get into the office once a week because some things are just better face to face.Cloud experience - Experience building applications that run in a cloud environment is essential. Experience configuring and maintaining cloud environments is also valuable.Ability to work in a team - You need to be able to communicate and collaborate effectively in a team environment. As a team we are continually trying to improve, so we are looking for people that want to contribute to that process with new ideas, technologies and approaches that drive our team and product forward.Gambling Industry - Must be willing to work in the gambling industry, we understand that isn't for everyone. Knowledge and background in gambling would be a plus.Front End Web Development - Experience in this area is a bonus. There are opportunities to work on the UI side of the platform but primarily this is a back end role.Education - A Bachelor's Degree or equivalent commercial experience.Qualifications3+ years experience in a similar role.  If you don’t have 3+ years experience but can point to relevant work that impresses this will be acceptable. University qualifications would be desirable but not essential.\n      \n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show more\n\n        \n    \n  \n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show less"

Fillr simply wants their team to be happy while producing products that make other people’s lives that little bit easier. Who is Fillr?Fillr is the world’s most accurate autofill technology, an ultra intelligent data exchange platform with a 95% + accuracy that is proven to be more accurate than Google/Apple’s autofill offerings. Pretty impressive for a small local Melbourne team, huh?It’s an exciting time to be joining Fillr as they are embarking on a new journey after merging with Rakuten Americas whose business portfolio includes market leaders in e-commerce, digital marketing, advertising, business intelligence, logistics, communications, and entertainment. The product They’ve rolled their auto-fill-as-a-service into a suite of mobile apps that are used by thousands of users daily in every country of the world.

To date, their 17 million members in the U.S. alone have earned over $3.7 billion in cash back at their favorite stores. How cool is that? It’s a fascinatingly complex system, with millions of users and that is at the very heart of their business.Rakuten Rewards directly puts money back into the pockets of users, which is pretty damn cool to think about. A product like this is all about driving greater accuracy within the product pipeline, ensuring users receive the rewards they deserve.

On average we’ve doubled in size every year for 10 years straight. Along the way we’ve helped more artists on their path to a sustainable career and sold more original artworks on the primary market than any other organisation in Australia’s history.The opportunityThis is an incredible opportunity for a product specialist to work in a high growth creative technology company. Our total team size has recently doubled to over 30 and we have an awesome pipeline of growth projects ahead. We want someone who can work alongside the Founders and CTO to build Bluethumb into the best online art platform in the world. We have succeeded so far by focusing on creating better technology for users. This won't change. Our next years are expanding our core market whilst launching expanding overseas. We will also enter the Secondary Art market and continue building out our NFT marketplace.RequirementsWhat You'll DoBe a staunch advocate for our users; our artists and art collectors. Speak up for the user at every point, dive deep on how they use Bluethumb, distill feature requests through a user-focussed lens. Alongside the CTO, help run the product team sprints. We currently have five full stack developers, a QA and a visual designer. We plan 3 week development sprints, with a code freeze week. Part of the role is roadmap planning ahead of each sprint to work out what we build next, and short retros afterwards. Manage and own the development board. This role is an intentional product team bottleneck. All new bugs, feature suggestions and epics are written into cards by the Product Owner. Ruthlessly prioritise what gets built and what doesn't. Wireframes are a bonus for briefing our designer, but not a must-have. Bring new product ideas to the team. Who We Are Looking ForA technology enthusiast. Someone who's curious about what's new.

Why working at Bluethumb might not work for you:We’re startup / scale up and there is a lot going on. You’ll need to keep the core business on track, deal with unexpected growth problems whilst concurrently launching new projects. You need to speak up to be heard. People are in different positions and places and you’ll need to be confident and a strong communicator.You’ll need to process a lot of information and be driven to quickly learn this and help us expand. We put ourselves in situations where failing publicly is a possibility. We understand this is life at Bluethumb and work as hard as possible to succeed, and when there’s failure we learn from the experience and pick ourselves back up to charge on.BenefitsYou’ll receive a competitive salary with the potential to qualify for ESOP (employee share option plan).If you are Melbourne or Adelaide based, we have amazing gallery & office spaces which are Dog-friendly. We are a distributed company with a great balance between WFH and office life. You get 4 weeks paid vacation, flexibility to take extra unpaid leave, and flexible working hours. We’re all about getting the work done, not just clocking time.Staff discounts on Australia’s best art! Fun team activities, lunches and projects.
